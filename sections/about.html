<h4>About</h4>
<p>Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, with a deep interest in researching and developing on what is called <b>neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence</b>. This past decade has seen a surge in neuroscience research and, as more and more data are gathered, the collaboration between these two historically intertwined disciplines will only become more relevant.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in the use of <b>eye-tracking</b> for its accessibility and potential for scalability. By employing it in natural reading experiments, my research centres on the development of machine learning language models that are able to incorporate such data, with the goal of providing a different perspective to them (changing the focus from the intentions of the writer to the perception of the reader) and, in doing so, attaining a better understanding of the <b>language representations</b> in the brain.</p>
<p>I have also begun working extensively on functional magnetic resonance imaging <b>(fMRI)</b>, performing data processing and functional network analysis of diverse cognitive disorders from a machine learning perspective. Part of the roadmap includes the employment of this technology for language experiments.</p>
<p>Besides these exciting projects, I continue to be actively involved in the maintenance of a benchmark for the task of <b>visual search</b> in natural scenes, which stemmed from my MSc thesis.</p>
