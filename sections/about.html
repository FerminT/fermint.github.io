<h4>About</h4>
<p>Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, with a deep interest in researching and developing at the intersection of <b>neuroscience and artificial intelligence</b>. This past decade has seen a surge in neuroscience research and, as more and more data are collected, the collaboration between these two historically intertwined disciplines will only become more relevant.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in the use of <b>(f)MRI</b>, for its unparalleled precision in mapping the structure and activity of the brain, and <b>eye-tracking</b>, for its accessibility and potential for scalability. Through the development of machine learning models that are able to incorporate such data, I aim to create <b>abstract representations</b> of the brain that help us answer deep questions regarding its structure and functionality.</p>
<p>In addition to these exciting projects, I continue to be actively involved in the maintenance of a benchmark for the task of <b>visual search</b> in natural scenes, which stemmed from my MSc thesis.</p>
