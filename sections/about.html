<h4>About</h4>
<p>Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, with a deep interest in researching and developing on what is called <b>neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence</b>. This past decade has seen a surge in neuroscience research and, as more and more data are gathered, the collaboration between these two historically intertwined disciplines will only become more relevant.</p>
<p>In particular, I am interested in the use of <b>eye-tracking</b>, for its accessibility and potential for scalability. By employing it in natural reading experiments, my research centres on the development of machine learning language models that are able to incorporate such data, with the goal of providing a different perspective to them (changing the focus from the intentions of the writer to the perception of the reader) and, in doing so, attaining a better understanding of the <b>language representations</b> in the brain.</p>
<p>My first encounter with eye movements as a window into the mind came in the form of my MSc thesis, where we built a benchmark for the task of visual search in natural scenes, one that I continue to maintain. My interest in <b>computer vision</b> is ongoing, as part of my research includes the development of mobile eye-tracking using peripheral devices such as webcams.</p>
