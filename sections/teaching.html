    <h4>Teaching</h4>

    <p>
    The challenge of effectively conveying a concept requires a deep understanding of the matter at hand, and is what motivates me the most in continuing in this path.
    Explaining <i> is </i> understanding.<br><br>

    The following extract is from David Goldstein's <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Feynman_s_Lost_Lecture.html?id=ysZI5NcksUcC&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none">book</a> on Feynman: </p>

    <blockquote>
    "Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, "Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics." Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But he came back a few days later to say, "I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it."
