    <h4>Teaching</h4>

    <p>
    I am currently a Head Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science department at Universidad de Buenos Aires.<br>
    The process of breaking down complex concepts into digestible pieces and witnessing students' gradual understanding 
    is incredibly rewarding. I firmly believe that teaching is one of the best ways to deepen one's own knowledge, 
    as it requires both mastery of the subject matter and the ability to view it from different perspectives.
