    <h4>Teaching</h4>

    <p>
    I am currently a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science department at the University of Buenos Aires.<br>
    I believe in the power of teaching for acquiring a deeper understanding of the concepts imparted, so I plan to continue down this path for a long time to come.</p>

    <p>
    Courses I have TA'd:
    <ul>
        <li> 1Q 2022: Algorithms and Data Structures I
        <li> 2Q 2021: Algebra (Workshop in Functional Programming)
    </ul>
    </p>
