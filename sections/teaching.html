    <h4>Teaching</h4>

    <p>
    I am currently a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science department at the University of Buenos Aires.<br>
    The challenge of acquiring an understanding of the concepts deep enough to convey them effectively is what motivates me the most in pursuing this path, one that I plan to follow for a long time to come.
