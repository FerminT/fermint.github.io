    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p> Before coming to MSR, I obtained a PhD in computer science from MIT, where I worked on
      various topics in machine learning and natural language processing under the
      supervision of <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/"> Tommi Jaakkola</a>.
      I also hold BSc (Licenciatura) and MS degrees in mathematics from
       <a href="https://www.itam.mx">ITAM</a> and  <a href="https://www.courant.nyu.edu/">Courant Institute (NYU)</a>,
       respectively. During the latter, I worked on semidefinite programming for
       domain adaptation under the supervision of <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/">Mehryar Mohri</a>.
       Between Master's and PhD, I spent a year at IBM's T.J. Watson
      Research Center, working with <a
      href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-kwchurch">Ken Church </a> and others in the Speech
      Recognition Group.
